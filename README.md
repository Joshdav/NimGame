# NimGame
This is the game "nim" but slightly altered. The game uses a min-max algorithm to implement an AI opponent.

How to play:

There are n coins in a pile (can be changed by setting the coins value in StateNim.java to another number) and the player and AI take turns removing 1-3 coins.
Whoever takes the last coin from the pile loses.
